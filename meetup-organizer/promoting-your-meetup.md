# Promoting your Meetup

Promoting a WordPress MeetupMeetup All local/regional gatherings that are officially a part of the WordPress world but are not WordCamps are organized through [https://www.meetup.com/](https://www.meetup.com/). A meetup is typically a chance for local WordPress users to get together and share new ideas and seek help from one another. Searching for ‘WordPress’ on meetup.com will help you find options in your area. is so much more than setting up a Meetup page. The Marketing Team has crowdsourced some of the things that have worked. We hope that this advice is helpful. Please note that these are suggestions, not requirements. Every community has their own nuance and flavor.

Each Meetup should have a static, repeatable event message that gets edited when a speaker or special event is planned. Also, will newcomers understand what your Meetup is about? How about new-to-WordPress people? Is it a class or a discussion? Have fresh eyes take a look at your Meetup page. Would a newcomer be able to easily find all information?

Familiarity eases anxiety for new people. Be sure Meetup organizers are included in, distinguishable, and tagged on group photos, when possible. Familiar faces and knowing who’s “in charge” diminish social anxiety for many.

Here are some suggestions from the Marketing Team ([Original Community Blog Post](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/08/03/promoting-your-local-wordpress-meetup/))
