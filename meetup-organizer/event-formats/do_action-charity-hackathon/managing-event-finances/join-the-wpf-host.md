# Join the WPF Host

Once you have created your collective, you will need to add your collective to the WordPress Foundation (WPF) ‘host’ collective. This will allow the WPF to be you fiscal host meaning that all of the financial transactions for your collective will be run through the WPF bank account.

To start, go to [the WPF host collective page here](https://opencollective.com/wpf) (you can also search for the WPF on the [hosts page](https://opencollective.com/hosts)).

Click on the blue “Apply to host your collective…” button in the page headerHeader The header of your site is typically the first thing people will experience. The masthead or header art located across the top of your page is part of the look and feel of your website. It can influence a visitor’s opinion about your content and you/ your organization’s brand. It may also look different on different screen sizes.:

You will get a message that says “application pending”. Wait for approval to join the WPF host – you can ask in the [#community-events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-events/) channel in SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform [https://slack.com/](https://slack.com/). The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at [https://make.wordpress.org/chat/](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/). to speed up this approval process.

And that’s it – next step is [creating an event within your collective](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/managing-event-finances/create-an-event/).
